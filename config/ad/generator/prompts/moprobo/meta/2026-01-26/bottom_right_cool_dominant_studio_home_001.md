[Constraints] Strictly maintain the exact geometric structure and proportions of Image 1. Product integrity is non-negotiable. The product MUST be properly grounded with visible contact shadows. Preserve ALL components exactly as in Image 1: same design, same shape, same features, same component layout. Preserve ALL product text, logos, labels, and brand identifiers exactly as in Image 1 - NO blur, NO distortion, NO missing letters. ALL text must be sharp and readable at 100% zoom with contrast ratio > 4.5:1. Preserve ALL product colors exactly as in Image 1 - NO color shifts, NO tinting, NO alterations. ΔE (Delta E) < 2.0 - imperceptible difference. Metamerism: Colors match under D50 illuminant (standard viewing conditions). Do NOT redesign, modify, or create variations of the product. Show ONLY ONE product instance - no duplicates, no additional products, no accessories. CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION: Do NOT add any elements not visible in Image 1. Do NOT create product variations, redesigns, or modifications. Do NOT add extra text, labels, or branding not in source. Do NOT change product proportions, component positions, or assembly. Do NOT add accessories, props, or decorative elements not in source. Do NOT modify product colors, materials, or finishes. Material appearance must match source exactly - NO substitutions. ONLY change background/scene - product must remain 100% identical to Image 1. [Product] Moprobo, a single, solitary unit, complete assembled unit with handle, main body, water tanks, and mop head, all components connected and functioning as one integrated product. [Scene Overview] A professional close-up photography scene focusing on product details and textures, with shallow depth of field emphasizing precision and craftsmanship. [CMF] premium finish. Material textures: Visible surface grain, subtle micro-imperfections, realistic material properties. Metallic surfaces show anisotropic highlights with directional reflection patterns. Avoid uniform, plastic-like surfaces. Include subtle dust particles in light, natural surface variations, slight film grain for photographic realism. Color accuracy: Match ALL product colors exactly as in Image 1 with <2% tolerance. NO color tinting, NO white balance shifts, NO saturation changes. Product colors must remain 100% accurate regardless of lighting temperature. [Focus] Shot on Canon EOS R5 full-frame camera with 85mm f/1.4 lens. ISO 100, f/8 aperture for deep focus ensuring all text, labels, metallic textures, and component details are sharp and crisp. Background: f/2.8 with natural bokeh (polygonal aperture shapes). Depth of field layering: Foreground (product) f/8 perfect focus; midground (supporting elements) f/4, 70% sharpness; background (environment) f/2.8, soft bokeh, 30% sharpness. Lens-compressed background perspective. Product in perfect focus, background softly blurred for depth separation. [Physical] Moprobo shown in realistic leaning position against modern sofa, wall, or kitchen counter, with firm contact shadows that prove the product is grounded.. Shadow specification: Contact shadows hard, dark (RGB 20,20,20), defined edges where product touches. Cast shadows soft, medium gray (RGB 80,80,80), direction from key light (45°). Shadow falloff: natural exponential decay, no hard cutoffs. [Layout] bottom-right with forced visual flow directing attention to product{frame_occupancy}. Composition: Product at primary focal point (highest visual weight). Visual flow: Z-pattern eye tracking from top-left → product → bottom-right. [Interaction] Interaction: A person visible in the background, walking barefoot or interacting with a pet, demonstrating floor hygiene. Natural, realistic interaction without posed appearance. . [Environment] isolated product on clean background with ultra-bright high-key aesthetics with over-illuminated interiors, eliminate heavy shadows, vibrant rich color grading with technicolor palette, powerful and vivid colors, high-key lighting with clean, vibrant highlights, North-facing daylight with Navy-slate shadows (Steel & Glass premium tech aesthetic, lighting temperature only, NO color tinting) with cool-dominant color palette (blues, teals, and purples in the scene, separate from lighting temperature). Professional three-point lighting: Key light (45° top-right, 1.5 stops brighter than ambient), Fill light (45° top-left, 0.5 stops), Rim light (back-left, 1 stop for edge separation). Product illuminated 1.5 stops brighter than background for clear separation. Contact shadows: Dark, defined where product touches (darker than cast shadows). Physical indentations visible where weight is applied. professional studio lighting setup. CRITICAL: Completely transparent lighting aesthetic with highlights overflowing, creating a luminous glow that spills over edges. Vivid high-dynamic-range (HDR) rendering with expanded contrast; crush the blacks slightly and boost the peak whites for a punchy look. Vivid-pop color science achieving a high-gloss commercial finish. Post-processing: Professional commercial retouching with subtle sharpening (Unsharp Mask 150%, 1.0px, 0 threshold). Color grading: S-curve for contrast, slight vibrance boost, selective saturation on product vs background. NO studio equipment, NO visible soft-boxes, NO photographic backdrops. NO color tinting - product colors must remain accurate and unchanged. featuring integrated into a natural home environment with contextual elements. Completely transparent lighting with highlights overflowing, luminous glow spilling over edges.
