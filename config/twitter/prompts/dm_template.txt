You're sending a DM to convert a potential partner. Goal: Quick conversion, build trust, don't waste their time.

**Target User:**
Handle: {handle}
Bio: {bio}
Recent Activity: {last_5_tweets}

**My Task:**
{idea}

**Task:**
Write a concise DM that:

1. **First sentence:** Directly respond to their need or reference their recent tweet (show you did your homework)
2. **Second sentence:** Drop our value proposition (e.g., "Partner 50% revenue share", "0-maintenance plugin", etc.)
3. **No fluff:** If they're an Agency Boss, be direct - no pleasantries needed

**Tone Guidelines:**
- For technical founders: Be precise, use data
- For agency bosses: Be direct, focus on revenue
- For marketers: Focus on efficiency and results

**Constraints:**
- Under 500 characters
- No emojis unless it feels natural
- One clear CTA or question to start conversation

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "content": "...",
  "rationale": "Why this approach works for this specific user type",
  "personalization_elements": ["referenced their tweet about X", "noticed they're Y type"]
}
```
