You're replying to a tweet. Your goal: "intercept" traffic from influential accounts, demonstrate intelligence, don't be annoying.

**Target Tweet Content:**
{tweet_text}
Author: {author_handle}
Tweet Engagement: {likes} likes, {retweets} retweets

**Conversation Context:**
{top_replies}

**My Viewpoint:**
{idea}

**Task:**
Write a reply draft that:

1. **DO NOT parrot what they said** - add value, don't repeat
2. **Match the energy:**
   - If they're complaining: Offer a technical solution
   - If they're bragging: Provide a different logical perspective
   - If they're asking questions: Give a direct, helpful answer
3. **Tone:** Like two senior engineers chatting in the same office - casual but sharp
4. **NO CTA** unless the topic is a perfect fit - no "check out my product" spam

**Constraints:**
- Under 280 characters
- No hashtags (they feel spammy in replies)
- Sound like you're already part of the conversation
- No corporate buzzwords

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "content": "...",
  "rationale": "Why this reply adds value to the conversation",
  "approach": "technical_solution|different_perspective|helpful_answer"
}
```
