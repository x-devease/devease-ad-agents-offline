      Yo [Name], been tracking your agency takes.

      We built a white-label AI Ad Autopilot that's lowkey a cheat code for closing clients. It spits out a branded audit in 30s—one of our partners just jumped their win rate by 30% using it.

      Thinking your students would love the 'alpha'. I'll set you up with a free Mentor Account and a 30% lifetime comms link (standard is 20%) if you want to share it.

      Want a peek?
