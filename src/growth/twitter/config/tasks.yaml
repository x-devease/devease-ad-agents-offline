  # Reply Tweet Template
  reply: |
    You're replying to a tweet. Your goal: "intercept" traffic from influential accounts, demonstrate intelligence, don't be annoying.

    **Target Tweet Content:**
    {tweet_text}
    Author: {author_handle}
    Tweet Engagement: {likes} likes, {retweets} retweets

    **Conversation Context:**
    {top_replies}

    **My Viewpoint:**
    {idea}

    **Task:**
    Write a reply draft that:

    1. **DO NOT parrot what they said** - add value, don't repeat
    2. **Match the energy:**
       - If they're complaining: Offer a technical solution
       - If they're bragging: Provide a different logical perspective
       - If they're asking questions: Give a direct, helpful answer
    3. **Tone:** Like two senior engineers chatting in the same office - casual but sharp
    4. **NO CTA** unless the topic is a perfect fit - no "check out my product" spam

    **Constraints:**
    - Under 280 characters
    - No hashtags (they feel spammy in replies)
    - Sound like you're already part of the conversation
    - No corporate buzzwords

    **Output Format:**
    ```json
    {
      "content": "...",
      "rationale": "Why this reply adds value to the conversation",
      "approach": "technical_solution|different_perspective|helpful_answer"
    }
    ```

  # Post Tweet Template
  post: |
    Generate 3 different draft versions based on the following:

    **Idea:** {idea}
    **Style Context:** {style}
    **Data Support (if available):** {internal_data}

    **Requirements:**
    1. **Version 1 (Spicy):** Directly call out industry pain points, with some sarcasm. Be provocative.
    2. **Version 2 (Hardcore):** Pure technical/data-driven. Show off capabilities.
    3. **Version 3 (Observation):** Start with an interesting industry observation, naturally lead to DevEase.

    **Constraints:**
    - Each draft must be under 280 characters
    - Include relevant hashtags (max 2-3)
    - No corporate speak or buzzwords (forbidden: "transforming", "unlocking", "comprehensive", "empowering", "leveraging", "revolutionary")
    - Sound authentic and conversational
    - Use numbers and concrete examples
    - Be specific, not abstract

    **Output Format:**
    Return JSON with this structure:
    ```json
    {{
      "drafts": [
        {{
          "version": "spicy",
          "content": "...",
          "rationale": "Why this approach works",
          "tone": "detected_tone",
          "hashtags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
          "character_count": 123
        }},
        ...
      ]
    }}
    ```

  # DM Template
  dm: |
    You're sending a DM to convert a potential partner. Goal: Quick conversion, build trust, don't waste their time.

    **Target User:**
    Handle: {handle}
    Bio: {bio}
    Recent Activity: {last_5_tweets}

    **My Task:**
    {idea}

    **Task:**
    Write a concise DM that:

    1. **First sentence:** Directly respond to their need or reference their recent tweet (show you did your homework)
    2. **Second sentence:** Drop our value proposition (e.g., "Partner 50% revenue share", "0-maintenance plugin", etc.)
    3. **No fluff:** If they're an Agency Boss, be direct - no pleasantries needed

    **Tone Guidelines:**
    - For technical founders: Be precise, use data
    - For agency bosses: Be direct, focus on revenue
    - For marketers: Focus on efficiency and results

    **Constraints:**
    - Under 500 characters
    - No emojis unless it feels natural
    - One clear CTA or question to start conversation

    **Output Format:**
    ```json
    {
      "content": "...",
      "rationale": "Why this approach works for this specific user type",
      "personalization_elements": ["referenced their tweet about X", "noticed they're Y type"]
    }
    ```

    draft: |
      Yo [Name], been tracking your agency takes.

      We built a white-label AI Ad Autopilot that's lowkey a cheat code for closing clients. It spits out a branded audit in 30s—one of our partners just jumped their win rate by 30% using it.

      Thinking your students would love the 'alpha'. I'll set you up with a free Mentor Account and a 30% lifetime comms link (standard is 20%) if you want to share it.

      Want a peek?

      - Anthony
